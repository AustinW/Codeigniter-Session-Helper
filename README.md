Codeigniter-Session-Helper
==========================

Codeigniter has numerous helpers that save time by shortcutting calls to sometimes incredibly long OOP function names and methods. The session helper aims to make reading, setting, deleting and updating data in Codeigniter sessions easy.

Simply autoload this helper in your config/autoload.php file. Add "session" to your array of autoloaded helpers or load it selectively in a controller or model using $this->load->helper('session').
